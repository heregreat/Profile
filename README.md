**Research Assistant**

*Characterizing Deprecated Deep Learning Python API: An Empirical Study on TensorFlow (Paper in Review)*

 - To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to reveal the current status of deprecated APIs in TensorFlow.

 - Performed the first research discovering the rationale behind deprecated APIs in TensorFlow. We analyzed the deprecation message in 235 deprecated APIs and found 6 API deprecation reasons.

 - Automatically uncover deprecated APIs in 12 existing deep learning models, which helps explore developers' reactions to TensorFlow deprecated APIs.

 - Present a quantitative study about the impact of deprecated APIs in deep learning models accuracies.heir model if they did not migrate their code timely.

*An Empirical Study of the Impact of Architecture Refactoring on Software Performance*

 - Investigated 46 architecture refactoring related commits from 3 popular Java framework HBase, Cassandra, Hadoop, and classified them into 4 self-defined architecture refactoring categories.
 - Run JUnit tests before and after commits to evaluate the performance (CPU Time, Memory Usage, and Response Time) difference.

**Algorithm Engineer**

*The Affective Benchmarking of Movies Based on the Physiological Data of Audiences*

 - Implemented a paper algorithm independently which consist of some signal analysis method like low-pass filter, moving average, etc, to monitors the affective benchmarking of movies based on the physiological responses of a real audience collected from Electro Dermal Activity (EDA) sensor.
 - This algorithm could be used to predict movies' box office, help director understanding audiences' emotion and improve the plot later.

- Implemented a coverage-guided fuzzer with jupyter notebook to test program bugs.
- Design of test case to detect four Java bug patterns defined in FindBugs.
- Implemented one Java project to detect three exception handling anti-patterns.
- Design of sparse matrix-vector multiplication algorithm with MapReduce technology using FLINK.
