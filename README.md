**Software Engineer** 

_Cloud | Gen AI_
- I was part of the team responsible for developing the Zilliz Cloud platform, a leading vector database company best known for Milvus. Our primary goal was to expand the availability of Zilliz Cloud on major cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP across multiple countries. This expansion aimed to establish a robust long-term memory foundation for Large Language Models (LLM).


- In addition, I made contributions to Gen AI projects related to vector databases, including RAG and data pipelines. These projects were focused on enabling organizations to rapidly develop AI/ML applications and harness the potential of unstructured data.

_S3 Index_
- I worked with the S3 Index at AWS, where I was part of a team focused on developing Incremental Backup Services. Our mission was to provide robust solutions for backing up the S3 Index, including critical data and partition metadata, to ensuring that the index data, which is fundamental to the performance of the service, could be securely and efficiently backed up.

*Characterizing Deprecated Deep Learning Python API: An Empirical Study on TensorFlow (Paper in Review)*

 - To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to reveal the current status of deprecated APIs in TensorFlow.

 - Performed the first research discovering the rationale behind deprecated APIs in TensorFlow. We analyzed the deprecation message in 235 deprecated APIs and found 6 API deprecation reasons.

 - Automatically uncover deprecated APIs in 12 existing deep learning models, which helps explore developers' reactions to TensorFlow deprecated APIs.

 - Present a quantitative study about the impact of deprecated APIs in deep learning models accuracies.

*An Empirical Study of the Impact of Architecture Refactoring on Software Performance*

 - Investigated 46 architecture refactoring related commits from 3 popular Java framework HBase, Cassandra, Hadoop, and classified them into 4 self-defined architecture refactoring categories.
 - Run JUnit tests before and after commits to evaluate the performance (CPU Time, Memory Usage, and Response Time) difference.

**Software Engineer**

*The Affective Benchmarking of Movies Based on the Physiological Data of Audiences*

 - Implemented an algorithm which monitors the affective benchmarking of movies based on the physiological responses of a real audience collected from Electro Dermal Activity (EDA) sensor.
 - This algorithm could be used to predict movies' box office, help director understanding audiences' emotion and improve the plot later.
